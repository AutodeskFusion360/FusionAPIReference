Demonstrates how to create a Volumetric Custom Feature using the API for graph creation.

To run the sample script, have a document open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will create a component with a box by sketching then extruding that sketch. It will then use that box as a boundary body and create a Volumetric Custom Feature.

The script will the create a gyroid lattice using the Volumetric Model API with the appropriate Graphs, Nodes and Connections for a minimal example. Finally, the script will convert that Volumetric Model to Mesh using the API and the VolumetricModelToMeshFeature.
